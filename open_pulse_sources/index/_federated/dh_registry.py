"""Registries for the discover/hydrate protocols.

Sibling to ``registry.py``. Kept in its own module so the
``IndexAdapter`` (search/lookup) registry stays decoupled — adapters
that don't yet implement discover/hydrate can still register for
search.

See :mod:`open_pulse_sources.index._federated.protocols` for the protocol definitions
and ``.internal/federated/discover-hydrate-design.md`` for the design
rationale.
