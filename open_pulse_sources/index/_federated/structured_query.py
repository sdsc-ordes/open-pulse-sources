"""Structured (faceted) query surface for the federated layer.

This is the structured-query analog of ``federated_search``.  Only adapters
that expose a ``facet_query`` method (and set ``structured_query = True``) are
accessible via this module.

Public API
----------
structured_query_capable() -> list[str]
    Names of registered adapters that have a ``facet_query`` attribute.

run_structured_query(index, filters, **kw)
    Load the adapter for ``index`` and call its ``facet_query`` method.
    Raises ``ValueError`` with a clear message if the adapter has no
    ``facet_query`` method.
