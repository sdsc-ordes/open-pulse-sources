"""GitHub organizations index — DuckDB + Qdrant catalog of GitHub org cards.

Each ingested org is one DuckDB row (`organizations` table) and one
or more Qdrant points (collection ``github_organizations``) holding a
chunked embedding of their composed text (name + description + blog +
location). Used by v2 extraction for disambiguation: given an
organization name or handle, find the most likely matching org.

Mirrors `open_pulse_sources.index.github_users` — both modules sit on the shared
``open_pulse_sources.index._github_accounts_base`` infrastructure.
