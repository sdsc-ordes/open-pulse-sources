"""Read-only DuckDB snapshot publication for the index stores.

The GME serving process holds a persistent read-write DuckDB handle on
each ``<provider>.duckdb``. DuckDB allows N readers **or** 1 writer
(exclusive), not both — so a *separate* process (the Hub) that opens the
live file read-only to sniff the schema fails with a lock conflict, the
collection never registers, and queries 404.

``publish_snapshot`` breaks the contention by writing a read-only *copy*
to ``<provider>.ro.duckdb`` after each ingest. Writer and readers then
operate on **different files** → zero contention, even mid-ingest. The
Hub points at the ``.ro.duckdb`` snapshot; the live file stays owned
solely by GME (which reads it in-process via its own writer connection).

The snapshot is produced through the live (writer) connection itself:
``CHECKPOINT`` (fold the WAL), copy each data table into a fresh temp DB
via ``CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT …``, then atomically ``os.replace`` the
temp over the snapshot. The heavy ``chunks`` table (embedding
bookkeeping, never served) is skipped. Best-effort — never raises into
the calling ingest job.

Toggles:
  * ``INDEX_DUCKDB_SNAPSHOT`` (default on) — set falsey to disable.
  * ``INDEX_SNAPSHOT_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` (default 0) — debounce: skip
    if the existing snapshot is younger than this (avoids re-copying a
    multi-GB store on every single-item ingest).
