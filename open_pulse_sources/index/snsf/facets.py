"""build_facets: populate the three derived facet tables from SNSF source data.

The tables (grant_persons, grant_output_counts, grant_countries) are defined in
storage/facets.sql and are also appended to storage/schema.sql so they exist
whenever SnsfStore.bootstrap() runs.

build_facets() is idempotent: it DELETEs all rows from the three tables before
rebuilding them from the source tables (grants, persons, output_*).  Re-running
after any reload is safe and produces correct counts.
