"""HuggingFace Papers index — DuckDB + Qdrant catalog of HF Papers cards.

Each ingested paper is one DuckDB row (`papers` table, keyed on
arXiv id) and one or more Qdrant points (collection
``huggingface_papers``) holding an embedding of title + abstract +
author names. The wire side hits the HF Papers REST endpoint
``GET /api/papers/{arxiv_id}`` directly — the existing HF Python
library doesn't expose papers.

Use cases:

  - Semantic search ("find papers about graph neural networks for
    materials science") returning HF-curated paper cards.
  - Disambiguation: given an arXiv id mentioned in a CITATION.cff or
    README, fetch HF's enriched view (AI summary, linked models /
    datasets, upvote signal).

Sibling to ``open_pulse_sources.index.github_users`` / ``open_pulse_sources.index.github_organizations``:
each owns its own DuckDB file + Qdrant collection; cross-cutting
infrastructure (chunk schema, embed loop, semantic search) is shared
via lightweight helpers.
