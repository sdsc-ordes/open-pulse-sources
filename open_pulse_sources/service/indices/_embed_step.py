"""Shared embed-after-ingest helper for the v2 ingest job runners.

Every provider's ingest job has two halves: a wire→DuckDB step
(the original ``_ingest_one_*`` loop) and a DuckDB→embed→Qdrant
step (the per-provider ``embed_*`` function). Historically only
the first half was chained into the API job runners; the second
had to be triggered out-of-band via CLI.

``run_embed_step`` lets each runner add the second half with one
``await`` and one closure, while keeping the embed failure mode
visible (recorded in the job ``summary['embed']`` block) and
non-fatal (an embed failure does not flip the ingest job to
``failed`` — the DuckDB writes already succeeded).

WAL checkpoint toggle
---------------------
The per-provider stores keep one long-lived DuckDB writer connection
cached on ``app.state`` and never close it between requests, so writes
sit in the ``-wal`` sidecar until DuckDB checkpoints (on clean
connection close, or when the WAL grows past its auto-threshold).
DuckDB *does* replay the WAL on the next open, so this is not data
loss — but until a checkpoint lands, a read-only probe from another
process sees the main file without the in-flight rows, and a hard
crash leaves a fat WAL to replay.

``run_embed_step`` therefore issues a single ``CHECKPOINT`` after each
job's embed step (success or failure — the ingest writes committed
either way), folding the main file forward. It is gated by the
``INDEX_DUCKDB_CHECKPOINT`` env var (default on); set it to a falsey
value (``0`` / ``false`` / ``no`` / ``off``) to skip the checkpoint and
keep the pre-existing WAL-deferred behaviour. The cost is one
checkpoint per job, not per batch, so it is negligible next to the
embed round-trips it follows.
