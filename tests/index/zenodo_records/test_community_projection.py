"""Community projection keeps numeric/ISSN community slugs (field report #6 v2).

Earlier (#101) we dropped grant-number / ISSN-shaped community ids, assuming
they were junk. They are NOT: those are real Zenodo communities whose slug
happens to be the grant number (e.g. the BIORECER project community has slug
`101060684`) or a journal ISSN. Zenodo's direct `GET /api/communities/<slug>`
returns an empty envelope for numeric slugs, which made them look dead — but
that is a resolution problem solved by `fetch_by_slug`'s search fallback, not a
reason to discard the link. So `_project_communities` must keep every slug.
